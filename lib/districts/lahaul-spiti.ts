      question: "How has the Atal Tunnel changed access to Lahaul-Spiti?",
      answer:
        "The Atal Tunnel (9.02 km), inaugurated in 2020, has revolutionized access to Lahaul Valley by providing year-round connectivity. Previously, the region was cut off for 6 months during winter when Rohtang Pass was closed. The tunnel has reduced travel time from Manali to Keylong from 5 hours to just 1.5 hours and boosted tourism and economic development.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is Spiti Valley called 'Little Tibet'?",
      answer:
        "Spiti Valley is called 'Little Tibet' because of its strong cultural, geographical, and religious similarities to Tibet. The region features Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, similar architecture, language, and customs. The landscape also resembles the Tibetan plateau with its high-altitude desert terrain.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is special about Tabo Monastery?",
      answer:
        "Tabo Monastery, founded in 996 CE, is over 1,000 years old and known as the 'Ajanta of the Himalayas' for its exquisite murals and stucco sculptures. It houses priceless collections of thangka paintings, manuscripts, and statues. The Dalai Lama has expressed that Tabo preserves Tibetan Buddhist culture better than many monasteries in Tibet itself.",

    {
      question: "What are the best trekking routes in Lahaul-Spiti?",

        "Popular trekking routes include the Pin-Parvati Pass trek connecting Spiti with Kullu Valley, the Parang La trek linking Spiti with Ladakh, the Hampta Pass trek, the Chandratal Lake trek, and the Pin Valley trek. These treks offer stunning landscapes, high mountain passes, and glimpses of rare wildlife.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best time to visit Lahaul-Spiti?",
      answer:
        "The best time to visit is from June to September when the weather is relatively mild and all areas are accessible. July-August can see some rainfall. May and October offer good conditions but can be colder. The region is largely inaccessible from November to April due to heavy snowfall, though the Atal Tunnel now provides year-round access to parts of Lahaul.",
